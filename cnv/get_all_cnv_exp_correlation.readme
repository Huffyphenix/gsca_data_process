#########Method:
use lm(expr ~ cnv) to calculate the relationship between genes' expression and cnv percentage.
expr = log2(expr + 1)
cnv data is raw data, from 0-1.
fdr= p.adjust(p.value, method = "fdr")
ars = adjust r.squared value.
filtered by fdr <= 0.05

Cancer, symbol, ars , fdr information are remained to use.
